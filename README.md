# Implementing Convolutional Neural Network Using CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. CNNs are highly effective for image recognition tasks due to their hierarchical architecture, which captures spatial dependencies and patterns within images.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNN is a deep learning algorithm designed for image recognition and processing. Its architecture includes:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply filters to extract features such as edges, textures, and patterns.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while retaining important features, improving computational efficiency.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine features to make predictions.

CNNs are inspired by the visual processing in the human brain, making them ideal for capturing hierarchical patterns in image data.
